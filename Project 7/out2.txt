    Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and     then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.     The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.     The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 
    

        Usage:
            pass:   give up, admit defeat
            exit:   exit the game
            i:      drop a disk into column i
    
Pick a color: white
You are 'white' and your opponent is 'black'.
